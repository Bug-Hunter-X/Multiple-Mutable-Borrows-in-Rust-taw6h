# Multiple Mutable Borrows in Rust
This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  Rust's borrow checker prevents this to avoid data races and ensure memory safety.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a solution.
